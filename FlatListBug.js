This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent key prop to its items.  Each item in the data array passed to FlatList must have a unique key.  If keys are duplicated or missing, FlatList may behave unpredictably, resulting in incorrect rendering, missing items, or performance issues.  A common cause is using the index as the key. This is unreliable as it can lead to issues when items are added or removed.
